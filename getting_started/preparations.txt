##############################33
Installing Ruby

Checked that I had Ruby greater then 2.5 (
  ruby -v  >>>> ruby 2.6.3p62......
  
##########################33
Using a code editor

I choose to keep with the editor in cloud 9

###############################3
Stylish Ruby

text editor
  - tab should be set to two spaces
  - indenting should be set to use spaces
  
# starts comments

snake_case
  - all methods, variables, file names
  
UPPERCASE
  - constants that will not change in program
  
when doing do/end blocks
  - use {} when the code fits on one line
  - use do/end when it goes over multiple lines
  
CamelCase
  - also called PascalCase
  - no spaces capitalize every word
  - use to define classes

Reading Documentation

important programmer habit
  - learn how to read documentation

API
  - acronym for application programming interface
  - can mean how applications talk to each other
  - or can mean the documentation
  
--------------------------------------------
How to read documentation String example
doc found at "https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6/String.html"

Three areas of focus

Class name or Module name
  - found in the top heading
  - can also be defined with ::
    .like Active::Base
    .This means that Base is the Class name or Module
    .Used to differentiate between classes with the same name but from a different namespace
    .the Module Active has a class named Base
    ! the :: at the top of the screen is different then those that are on the side of the screen which defines class methods
  - rest of the page will be documenting that class or module

Methods
  - listed with a :: or #
  - :: < used for class methods
  - # < used for instance methods
  ! use in documentation of :: and # completely different then how they are used in the code
  - clicking on a class or instance method will bring you to a section showing parameters, return values, and some example ruby code

-----------rb----------
a = "world wide web".split
puts a 

# .split is a class method from the string class, can be called directly on the string


b = String.new("blue")
puts "string b: #{b}"

String.try_convert("red")

# made a new string with text blue,
# not sure what .try_convert does yet

----------------------------------
three most important things to remember when reading documentation
  - The class or module you are looking at
  - where to find its available class/instance methods
  - how to use those methods

----------------------------------------
Other sections on the documentation page
--------------------------------------
Parent

Every subclass comes from parent class
  - need to know object orientated programming to fully understand
  - the subclass has access to methods (instance and class) documented in the parent class
  
-----------example-----------------
string parent is object
  - the methods of objects are also available to strings
  - use link to learn about parent object if unfamiliar or aren't finding the expected methods
  

------------------------------------
Class Module Index

All classes are part of a namespace in Ruby
  - this section lists other classes and modules from same namespace
  - those with :: are indicating a namespace

------------------------------------
Included modules

indicates other modules whose functionality is available to the string class

-----------------
Comparable module is include

c = "cat".between?("ant","zebra")

puts "Is cat between ant and zebra? #{c}"

# between? is not in string documentation, but under comparable mudule > listed under included modules 

-------------
when in doubt review documentation for the version you are running
https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/

###################################
Command line and irb

----------------
command line
  - mkdir
  - cd
  - touch
  - rm
  - rm -r
  
covered making a directory, a file, and removing them invididually or one at a time.
Also covered changing folders

----------------
irb
  - ruby interactive environment that can be run in the command line without creating a separate ruby file
  - started by typing "irb" in the command line
  - exited by typing "exit"
  - defualt prompt shows which version of ruby is running
  - can type ruby commands and see outputs in the command line interactive environment

--------------
running ruby code
  - after creating a code with the .rb extension
  - run code by typing
    ruby file_name
  - code is executed by an interpreter
    . takes code and translates into something computer will understand
  - stopping endless loops
    control - c

----------------
Remember

there is a difference between running commands command line to manage files and folders,
running ruby commands in irb,
and running ruby code from file in command line

####################################
What are ruby gems?

Ruby "Gems"
  - RubyGems
  - gems for short
  - collection of Ruby files or Ruby libraries that perform a certain tas,
  - publishing system that organizes listing and publishing those libraries/gems
  
rubygems.org
  - website that powers system for downloading, publishing, and using useful ruby libraries on your system
  - the libraries are called gems
  
Ruby Gems
  - intergrated into Ruby 1.9 and newer
  - prepackaged bundle of code to solve a problem.
  - don't have to reinvent the wheel
  - gem is cut when new version is available
  - all public gems hosted at http://rubygems.org
  - code is usually on github
  
How to use

gem command
  - use with install command
  
-------
gem install <gem name>

  - good for one-time usage
  - gemfile simple solution for storing gems and dependancies
    . learn later
  - for now know that you can install a small ruby gem using gem install <gem name> for course until taught more

Debuggin with pry

pry
  - library double for irb
  - very usefull for debuggin
  - have to install first
  
gem install pry

  - now use pry to enter pry environment
  - can also use in ruby files
 
 ------------------ 
require "pry"

a = [1, 2, 3]
a << 4
binding.pry     # execution will pause here, allowing you to inspect all objects
puts a
--------------

use require "pry" at top
binding.pry pauses program
  - pauses and opens a pry session
  - continue with Ctrl + D
  - better alternative to puts in your code
