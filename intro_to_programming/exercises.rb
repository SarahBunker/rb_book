#Challenge: In exercise 11, we manually set the contacts hash values one by one. Now, programmatically loop or iterate over the
#contacts hash from exercise 11, and populate the associated data from the contact_data array. Hint: you will probably need to
#iterate over ([:email, :address, :phone]), and some helpful methods might be the Array shift and first methods.
#Note that this exercise is only concerned with dealing with 1 entry in the contacts hash, like this:
contact_data = ["joe@email.com", "123 Main st.", "555-123-4567"]
contacts = {"Joe Smith" => {}}
#As a bonus, see if you can figure out how to make it work with multiple entries in the contacts hash.

#-----------------------------
# I think my solution is also the solution for the challange prompt
# I looked at the statement of how I thought I might be able to improve, but i don't know the value at that index
# which is why I am using that index is to get the value

# the hints say that .first or .shift might help, but I think using the index to access the values is cleaner because I
# don't need the values returned or removed I just need access to them in order to store them in the hash.

# I just want to record the feeling of being so hyped because my solution that took longer to come up with
# was the solution to the challenge problem that I had heard in chats was so hard that people wondered if anyone actually did it
# and not only did I do it, but I did it without their hints and in 7 lines of code. SO EXCITED!!!!
# I am also excited that I stopped checking my work after each problem after problem 4 so I could be suprised to know that my answer
# was more robust then they asked for in problem 11 and be suprised when I had already solved the challenge problem.
