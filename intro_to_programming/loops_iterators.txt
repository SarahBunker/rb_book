Simplest loop
  - loop takes a block
  - excutes code within block until
    * manually press ctrl+c
    * insert a break statement inside block
    
remember a block is code within do...end or {}

loop do
  puts "This will keep printing until you hit Ctrl + c"
end

Adding in breaks
  - to avoid an infinite loop add a break statement
  - doesn't close program just exits loop
